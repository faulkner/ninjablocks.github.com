  <p><strong>cURL tip:</strong> JSON responses on the command line can be very hard to read. The simplest way is to get <a href="https://github.com/trentm/json">this excellent json script</a> and then add pipe to json <code>| json</code> at the end of your curl commands. Slightly more work to install but well worth the effort if you regularly work with restful APIs is the python utility <a href="https://github.com/jkbr/httpie">HTTPie</a>.</p>
