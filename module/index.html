  <h1>Module [DRAFT]</h1>
  <p>Modules are pieces of software the interface between the Ninja platform and hardware devices. Think of them like hardware drivers. At present our only client is written in Node.js, therefore so are our modules.</p>
  <p>There are 2 important parts to a module:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/module/constructor.html">A constructor</a> responsible for registering; </li>
      <li><a href="/module/device.html">Devices</a></li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    The point of a constructor is to register devices with the Ninja Cloud. A `Device` is an object that has standard properties/methods that allow us to actuate/read it.
