  <h1>Module [DRAFT]</h1>
  <p>
    Modules are pieces of software the interface between the Ninja platform and hardware devices. Think of them like hardware drivers that run inside of our <a href="https://github.com/ninjablocks/client" target="_blank">client</a>. Our client is written in Node.js, therefore so are our modules.
  </p>
  <p>
    A module is made up of a
    <big><a href="/module/constructor.html">constructor</a></big> responsible for registering
    <big><a href="/module/device.html">devices</a></big> that speak certain
    <big><a href="/protocol">protocols</a></big>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The protocol they talk is defined by their <code>device_type</code> which itself is derived from the device's <code>G</code>, <code>V</code>, and <code>D</code>. (See <a href="/core-concepts.html">core concepts</a> for more on that).
  </p>
  <p>
    The constructor/device both have methods/properties/events associated with them that provide an interface the Ninja client can understand.
