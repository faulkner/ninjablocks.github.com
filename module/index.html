  <h1>Module [DRAFT]</h1>
  <p>
    Modules are pieces of software that interface between the Ninja platform and hardware devices. Think of them as hardware drivers that run inside our <a href="https://github.com/ninjablocks/client" target="_blank">client</a>. Our client is written in Node.js, therefore so are our modules.
  </p>
  <p>
    A module is made up of a
    <big><a href="/module/constructor.html">constructor</a></big> responsible for registering
    <big><a href="/module/device.html">devices</a></big> that speak certain
    <big><a href="/protocol">protocols</a></big>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The protocol they talk is defined by their <code>device_type</code> which itself is derived from the device's, <code>V</code>, and <code>D</code>. (See <a href="/core-concepts.html">core concepts</a> for more on that).
  </p>
  <p>
    The constructor/device both have methods/properties/events associated with them that provide an interface the Ninja client can understand.
  </p>

  <h2>Writing a Module Quick Start Guide [WIP]</h2>

  <h3>Step 1 - pick the device(s) you'll be working with</h3>
  <p>Soon you will be able to register as your own vendor (thus getting your own <code>V</code>) and manage your own device list, however until then we have a big list of generic devices that you can choose from. <a href="http://ninjablocks.com/pages/device-ids" target="_blank">The list is located here</a>.</p>

  <h3> Step 2 - look up its protocol</h3>
  Each device type has a different protocol that must be adhered to so that other developers can understand how to talk to your devices. <a href="/protocol/list.html" target="_blank">The list of protocols we have written (so far) is located here</a>.
  <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Note: these protocols are meant to be written by the community</strong>. If you want to contribute, submit a pull request to this documentation, which itself is just a GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/ninjablocks/ninjablocks.github.com" target="_blank">located here</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Step 3 - work on our client's develop branch (temporary).</h3>
  <p><a href="http://ninjablocks.com/blogs/how-to/7195176-hack-like-a-ninja-blocks-developer" target="_blank">We wrote a How-To on that here</a>.</p>

  <h3>Step 4 - create a module scaffold</h3>
  <p>We have a beta CLI tool to help with this, <a href="https://github.com/ninjablocks/ninja-toolbelt" target="_blank">it is located here</a>.</p>

  <h3>Step 5 - modify the device with the vendor (V) and device (D) IDs from Step 1</h3>
  <p>If you used our CLI from step 4, this will be in <code>PATH_TO_NINJA_CLIENT/ninja_modules/&lt;module name&gt;/lib/device.js</code>.</p>
