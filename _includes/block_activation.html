  <h3>Block Activation Explained</h3>

  <p>The process of claiming / activating a block is the process of retrieving a token for that particular block (identified by its node ID) that is tied to a user account.</p>
  <p>There are two flows to block activation. First, you can request a token with user credentials. This is useful for browsers and other apps that already have a user's authorization.</p>
  <p>The second involves a two-legged flow where a block requests a token and awaits activation (HTTP GET, does not require user authorization) and a user separately attempts to claim that block awaiting activation (HTTP POST, does require authorization). For example an Arduino might request activation, and a user then 'claims' that block via his/her browser/smartphone. The token is sent down the wire to the Arduino which then uses it in all subsequent requests.</p>
